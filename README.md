Application exploring AVAudioRecorder, writing/reading to iCloud
Application Called "What's that Whistle" Where a user can whistle a tune and it is saved to iCloud and other users can listen to the
tune and pick a genre and post an comment. @ www.hackingwithswift.com Lesson 33.
Lessons learnt - Recording from microphone with AVAudioRecorder, Animating UIStackViews and SubView layout. Hard coding UIStackViews
Writing to iCloud with CloudKit and CKAssets. CloudKit dashboard, reading from iCloud, Querying iCloud, Using operation and
NSPredicates, Working with CloudKit recordsCKReference, fetch and subscription. AVAudioSessions, ReuestRecordPermissions.

Unfortunately, iCloud Dashboard was not picking up my whistles either from the simulator or my device so unsure what the problem was.
This was a very long project with lots of different subject matter covered.
